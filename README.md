In our study, we automated the classification of rice grains as chalky or non-chalky using various
segmentation techniques. One key finding was the significant impact of background selection
on classification results. We observed a bias towards categorizing grains as chalky when hand
backgrounds were present, highlighting the necessity of controlled lighting conditions for accurate
classification.

Another notable discovery was the advancement of YOLOv9 over YOLOv8, showcasing the
continual evolution of deep learning models. The benefits of these advancements emphasize the
importance of staying updated with technological innovations to enhance classification accuracy
and efficiency.

However, our research also highlighted challenges in dataset selection, including issues
such as excessive class diversity, imbalanced distributions, and poor image quality. These
challenges underscore the critical need for high-quality, well-curated datasets to optimize model
performance.

Furthermore, the Segmentation-Aware Module (SAM) emerged as a superior segmentation
technique due to its adaptability and robustness. SAMâ€™s ability to adjust and learn from diverse
scenarios mitigated the impact of dataset quality and lighting variations, showing promise for
overcoming challenges in rice grain classification. Overall, our study contributes to the ongoing
development of automated methods for rice quality assessment, offering valuable insights for
future research endeavors
